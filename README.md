# Spotify Data Analysis - Data Engineering

### Overview

In this project, we perform data engineering on Spotify data using various tools and technologies. Amazon EC2 was used to host an instance on the cloud. On this instance, Apache Airflow DAGs were run and data was brought from Spotify using Spotipy API and dumped into an Amazon S3 bucket. Useful data was sorted using Pandas library.
